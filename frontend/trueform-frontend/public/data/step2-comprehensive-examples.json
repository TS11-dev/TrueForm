  "step": "Comprehensive .form Example Library Creation",
  "description": "Created 4 additional detailed .form examples demonstrating diverse cognitive patterns and edge cases that validate the schema design and prepare for robust parser testing. The examples cover adaptive learning with feedback loops, multi-path constraint satisfaction, hierarchical modular composition with shared resources, and formula-heavy computational reasoning for risk assessment.",
  "code": [
    {
      "language": "json",
      "filename": "example-adaptive-learning.form",
      "content": "Demonstrates reinforcement learning patterns with strategy selection, performance memory, feedback processing, confidence adjustment, and exploration vs exploitation decisions. Shows temporal extensions, learning parameters, and policy gradient-style adaptation mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "language": "json",
      "filename": "example-constraint-solver.form", 
      "content": "Complex multi-path branching logic for resource allocation with CPU/memory/budget constraints. Demonstrates conditional relations, constraint satisfaction optimization, preemption evaluation, and parallel execution with multiple exit points."
    },
    {
      "language": "json",
      "filename": "example-hierarchical-composition.form",
      "content": "Hierarchical task management with planning and execution modules containing sub-nodes. Shows shared global state (context, knowledge base, resources), inter-module coordination, and dependency management across module boundaries."

      "language": "json",
      "filename": "example-computational-reasoning.form",
      "content": "Mathematical risk assessment model with 11 formula nodes for volatility calculation, beta analysis, VaR computation, portfolio optimization, and stress testing. Demonstrates sandbox security, numerical validation, and complex mathematical transformations."

  "next_steps": "Ready to proceed to STEP 3: Build the .form parser and validator with comprehensive schema validation, reference resolution, cycle detection, and robust error handling. The diverse example library provides excellent test cases for validating parser correctness and edge case handling.",
  "questions": [
    "Should I proceed directly to building the parser/validator backend, or would you like to see any other specific cognitive patterns demonstrated?",
    "For the parser implementation, do you prefer Node.js with TypeScript or Python for the backend? Both have excellent JSON schema validation libraries.",
    "Should the parser include real-time validation capabilities for live .form editing, or focus on batch validation for file processing?"
