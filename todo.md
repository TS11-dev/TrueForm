# TrueForm Platform Completion Plan

## Objective: Complete the TrueForm cognitive platform with execution engine, API, and frontend

## Current State Analysis:
✅ FormTypes.ts - Complete type definitions for .form structure
✅ FormValidator.ts - Working AJV-based validation system  
✅ FormCompiler.ts - Complete compilation with optimizations and complexity analysis
✅ FormPlatform.ts - Partial facade implementation
❌ FormExecutor.ts - **MISSING** - Core execution engine
❌ Express API server - **MISSING** - REST endpoints
❌ React frontend - **MISSING** - Web interface
❌ Tests - **MISSING** - Test suite

## STEPS:

[ ] STEP 1: Complete FormExecutor.ts implementation with sequential, parallel, and adaptive execution modes → System STEP
[ ] STEP 2: Complete FormPlatform.ts facade with execution integration and caching → System STEP  
[ ] STEP 3: Build Express REST API server with validation, compilation, and execution endpoints → System STEP
[ ] STEP 4: Create React frontend with .form editor, graph visualizer, and execution interface → Web Development STEP
[ ] STEP 5: Implement comprehensive test suite for all backend modules → System STEP
[ ] STEP 6: Integration testing and end-to-end workflow validation → System STEP

## Deliverable: Complete TrueForm Platform with:
- ✅ Full backend execution engine capable of running .form cognitive workflows
- ✅ REST API for programmatic access to all platform features  
- ✅ Web interface for creating, editing, and executing .form files
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliability
- ✅ End-to-end workflows from .form creation to execution results
